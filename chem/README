This directory contains the WRF-Chem 3.5.1 files that have been modified in the study Mues et al.,
"Air quality in the Kathmandu Valley: WRF and WRF-Chem simulations of meteorology and black carbon concentrations",
Geosci. Model Dev. The following two modifications have been applied:

- added gravitational settling of aerosol particles for chem_opt=41 (RADM2/MADE/SORGAM)
- fix to prevent sea salt emissions from small in-land lakes in the Himalayas
